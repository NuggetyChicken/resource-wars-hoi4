ROM_petrikovshchina_idea:0 "§YPetrikovshchina§!"
ROM_petrikovshchina_idea_desc:0 "§YPetrikovshchina§!, the ideology espoused by the current Romanian government, derives its name from §YCorvid Petrikov§!, the incumbent RCP secretary. Despite his military background, §YPetrikov§! implemented a multi-party system, drawing inspiration from the early 21st-century reformist policies of the USSR. However, this system failed to ameliorate Romania's condition, leading to widespread disillusionment with communism following a devastating crisis. The crisis, exacerbated by the actions of §YPetrikov's§! predecessor, has fueled a growing sentiment among the Romanian populace favoring the collapse of the communist regime."
ROM_iron_guard_idea:0 "§GIron Guard§!"
ROM_iron_guard_idea_desc:0 "In recent times, there has been a revival of interest in the Iron Guard, an extremist nationalist movement from the 20th century, particularly among those who oppose communist ideology in Romania. This resurgence has attracted the attention of individuals from various sectors, including military personnel and political figures, who have aligned themselves with the group now known as the New Iron Guard. \n\nThe increasingly radical actions undertaken by this organization raise concerns about unforeseen repercussions, the likelihood of which intensifies daily."
ROM_generatia_egalitatii:0 "§YGeneratia Egalitatii§!"
ROM_generatia_egalitatii_desc:0 "§YGeneratia Egalitatii§! (Equality Generation) is a Romanian social democratic civil society organization that emerged in 2048 amid disillusionment among a large part of the population with communist reformism, which promised renewal but left many problems unresolved. The organization seeks to create a more just and equitable society while maintaining respect for the stability and peace provided by the existing regime. However, its members criticize the bureaucracy and corruption that undermine confidence in reform. \n\nThe organization brings together activists from different age groups, but is particularly popular among young people who want to see more transparency and social justice. §YGeneratia Egalitatii§! actively promotes ideals of equality in access to education, health and social benefits, believing that resources should be redistributed more equitably to minimize class differences. \n\nWhile §YGeneratia Egalitatii§! condemns violence and advocates for peaceful change, it plays a critical voice within the system, trying to influence the authorities through civic participation, dialog and campaigning for reform. The organization believes in the possibility of peaceful change through the active involvement of the population in the political process, but its calls for greater social responsibility often resonate with those dissatisfied with slow reforms and inequality. \n\n§YGeneratia Egalitatii§! thus represents a bridge between the reformist communist state and popular sentiment, advocating stability and pacifism, but at the same time demanding that the authorities listen to the needs of ordinary citizens and seek real change."
